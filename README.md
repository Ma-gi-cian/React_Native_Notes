## React Native 
Javascript framework for cross platform application development.

Aim of the notes app : 
- CRUD on notes
- attach the functionality of the header image in notes.
- when note opened if the note has a header image the image should be shown with the some note text in the main menu.
- Date and time functionality
- Add a timer setting ( 15 - 11 - 24 -> long press on this date a calander ui should open and we can set timer for this date on any time)
- share the notes with timer
- Far in the future -> have this cross platform -> like on the web, on the desktop ( would be good )
